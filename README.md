# Squad-Matching-Algorithm

A key aspect of the RadicalX group internships is matching interns to a squad that matches their preferences.
The onboarding process for all interns includes a detailed form where they enter the internships they are interested in, their preferences for their squad, 
their preferred start date, their educational and work background, and self-rating of skills that are relevant to the internship.
